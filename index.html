        <h4>What is love ?</h4>

        
        <p id="p">Romantic love is often characterized by feelings of passion, intimacy, and commitment towards a partner.

            
            Marriage is a legally recognized and socially sanctioned union between two individuals, typically involving a
        formal ceremony and the exchange of vows. It is a commitment between two people to share their lives together,
        often with the goal of building a life-long partnership and starting a family.</p>
